# RoboND-SLAM-Project

This is the seventh project of the Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree. A robot fitted with a Kinect RGB-D camera and hokuyo laser maps two different simulated environments created in Gazebo: kitchen_dining.world and collapsed.world, both sdf files located in the worlds folder of the slam_project package. The online SLAM problem is solved for a robot exploring these two Gazebo environments with the mapping and localiztion tool RTAB-Map integrated with real-time visualization in RViz. A 2-D occupancy grid map is created and a 3-D point cloud is made and more than 3 loop closures are accounted for in each teleoperated run of the robot. A slam_project package is created which includes world files, launch files, urdf files, configuration files, scripts, and mesh files needed to perform SLAM with a simulated robot. Assembly of urdf files to include sensor plug-ins and sensor frames that control the properties and topics of sensors, building world files with Gazebo's model database, and remapping topics, setting parameters for nodes, and adding static tf transforms to launch files for effective rqt_graph communication and tf tree construction are some of the tasks that are completed to organize the slam_project pacakge for proper execution of RTAB-Map. More information about the set-up for mapping is detailed in the model configuration section of the SLAM write-up.
